  about: [
    "I'm a full-stack developer working remotely from Asunción, Paraguay. I specialize in React Native, EMV payment terminals and video game development, and I enjoy taking products from a blank repo all the way to production.",
    "Today I build POS applications at ITTI. I'm also CTO at Happy Living, co-founder and CTO of Rebuscate, and I make games with Impossible Games, self-hosting most of the tooling behind them.",
    "I've been working in tech since 2014, from IT support and teaching computer science to leading engineering, and I hold a degree in Computer Engineering from UTCD.",
    "Away from the keyboard I tinker with electronics, design parts in Fusion 360 and Blender, and print them on FDM and resin printers. I also do penetration testing, which keeps the security side of my work sharp.",
    "Lately I'm digging into machine learning, big data, payment processing and game design. Fun fact: I like turtles. 🐢",
